This project focuses on classifying aerial landscape images using traditional (KNN/SVM with LBP/SIFT) and deep learning models (VGG16, DenseNet121, YOLOv5, ResNet18). ResNet18 achieved the highest F1-score (0.9709). We applied Grad-CAM for interpretability and addressed class imbalance. Completed as part of COMP9517 at UNSW.
